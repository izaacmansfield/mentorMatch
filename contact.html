    <main>

    <div class="desc">
        <p>Mentor Match is a revolutionary mentoring/tutoring service that allows students in universities to find the best mentor for them through a 
        tinder-style matching system where they will be rated out of 5 stars based on their performance. Upon sign up, the mentor/mentee will be 
        asked for relevant information like name, school year, and teaching style and students will be able to choose who they would best work with. 
        We also offer a rewards store for our mentors as an incentive to increase the number of tutors on our platform.</p>
